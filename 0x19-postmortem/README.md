**íº¨ Humorous Postmortem Alert! íº¨**

**Issue Summary:**

- **Duration:** May 5, 2024, 08:00 UTC to May 6, 2024, 04:00 UTC
- **Impact:** We had a database hiccup! Think of it as a momentary existential crisis for our servers. Approximately 30% of users experienced a rollercoaster ride of slow loading times and occasional errors.

**Timeline:**

- **May 5, 08:00 UTC:** Our monitoring system started screaming louder than a banshee at a heavy metal concert, alerting us to database connectivity failures.
- **May 5, 08:15 UTC:** The engineering team got the distress signal and sprinted into action.
- **May 5, 08:30 UTC:** We went on a wild goose chase, chasing ghosts in the network and server logs, convinced we had a rogue gremlin causing mischief.
- **May 5, 10:00 UTC:** Alas, no gremlins were found, so we called in the database specialists, hoping they could exorcise whatever demons lurked within our servers.
- **May 5, 12:00 UTC:** The specialists uncovered some alarming spikes in CPU usage, like a heart monitor gone haywire during a soap opera's dramatic climax.
- **May 5, 14:00 UTC:** We slapped some metaphorical Band-Aids on the problem, redistributing the load like a juggler trying to keep too many balls in the air.
- **May 5, 16:00 UTC:** Despite our best efforts, the issue persisted, so we summoned the senior engineers, hoping their wisdom would shine light on our dark server room.
- **May 5, 18:00 UTC:** Lo and behold! They discovered a misconfigured database query, a digital needle in the haystack of code.
- **May 5, 20:00 UTC:** With the precision of a digital surgeon, we optimized the query, giving our servers a much-needed tune-up.
- **May 5, 22:00 UTC:** We held our breath and crossed our fingers as we monitored the system, hoping our fix would hold.
- **May 6, 04:00 UTC:** Victory! The service was resurrected, and our servers danced with joy once more.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

- **Root Cause:** A poorly optimized database query was hogging CPU like it was the last piece of pizza at a party.
- **Resolution:** We whipped that query into shape, reducing its resource consumption and making it as efficient as a well-oiled machine. Plus, we tweaked our monitoring to catch any similar shenanigans in the future.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Instituted regular code reviews to catch code that's slacking off.
  - Beefed up our monitoring to sniff out troublemakers before they wreak havoc.
  - Scheduled performance tests to put our servers through their paces and ensure they're in tip-top shape.
- **Tasks:**
  1. Conduct code review for all database queries to ensure they're pulling their weight.
  2. Update monitoring thresholds to sound the alarm at the first sign of trouble.
  3. Regularly test our system under peak loads to make sure it can handle the heat.
  4. Documented our newfound wisdom in a sacred tome of best practices to guide future generations of engineers.

By implementing these measures and putting the demons of the past to rest, we're forging ahead into a future of smoother sailing and happier servers.
