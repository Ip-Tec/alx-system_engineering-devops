##What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter?

As we navigate the vast landscape of the internet, we often take for granted the intricate processes that occur behind the scenes when we enter a URL into our browser and hit Enter.

In this blog post, we’ll embark on a journey through the various layers of the web stack, unraveling the complexities that culminate in the rendering of a web page. So, let’s dive in and explore what exactly happens when we type “https://www.google.com" into our browser.

#DNS Request
The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. When you type “https://www.google.com" into your browser, your computer doesn’t immediately know how to reach Google’s servers. It sends a DNS query to a DNS server, asking for the IP (Internet protocol) address associated with the domain name “www.google.com". The DNS server then responds with the corresponding IP address, such as 172.217.12.174. When this is done it automatically move to the next step

#TCP/IP
Armed with the IP address, your browser initiates a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to the server at that address. TCP is responsible for establishing a reliable connection between your computer and the server, ensuring that data packets are delivered in the correct order and without errors.

#Firewall
Before establishing the TCP connection, the data packets may need to pass through a firewall. A firewall acts as a barrier between your computer and the internet, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on predefined security rules. It helps protect your system from unauthorized access and malicious activities.

#HTTPS/SSL
In the case of “https://” URLs (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), an additional layer of security comes into play. Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or its successor Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols encrypt the data exchanged between your browser and the server. This encryption ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials or payment details, remains confidential during transit.

#Load-Balancer
Large websites like Google often employ load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. A load balancer acts as a traffic cop, directing each request to the most suitable server based on factors like server load, proximity, and health. This ensures optimal performance and prevents any single server from being overwhelmed by traffic.

#Web Server
Once the TCP connection is established and the HTTPS handshake is completed, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server specified by the IP address. The web server, such as Apache or Nginx, receives the request and processes it accordingly.

#Application Server
In many cases, especially with dynamic websites or web applications, the web server forwards the request to an application server. The application server executes the necessary code (e.g., PHP, Python, Java) to generate the requested content dynamically. This could involve querying databases, processing user input, or fetching data from external sources.

#Database
If the requested content relies on data stored in a database, the application server communicates with the database server to retrieve or manipulate the required information. This interaction could involve querying the database, updating records, or performing other data operations.

#Conclusion:
The journey of a web request, from typing a URL into your browser to receiving the desired content, involves a symphony of technologies working together seamlessly. Understanding these components not only demystifies the inner workings of the internet but also provides insights into the complexities of modern web development and infrastructure management. The next time you browse the web, take a moment to appreciate the intricate dance of DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases that make it all possible.
